# Random_Forest
# Project Title:
Analysis and predicting iris species with the random forest
# Problem Statement:
Random Forest is an assemble technique capable of performing both
regression and classification tasks with the use of multiple decision
trees and a technique called Bootstrap and Aggregation, commonly
known as bagging.The basic idea behind this is to combine multiple
decision trees in determining the final output rather than relying on
individual decision trees.
Random Forest has multiple decision trees as base learning
models.We randomly perform row sampling and feature sampling
from the dataset forming sample datasets for every model.This part is
called bootstrap.
We need to approach the Random Forest regression technique like any
other machine learning technique.
# project methodology:
â–¾ RandomForestClassifier
RandomForestClassifier()
# project approached:
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
print(f"Accuracy: {accuracy:.2f}")
Accuracy: 1.00
# conclusion:
Analyised the iris species with random forest.
